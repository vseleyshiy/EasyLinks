# EasyLinks
This is a program that automatically opens _all your links_ that you have specified.

## Get started
Install all the necessary dependencies from the __requirements.txt__ file into your venv folder.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the program to work, you need to run the __main.py__ file in the root of the folder.

After launching the application, you will need to indicate the number of links you want to add and then enter them into a special input field.

Once you have entered the links, restart the program using the convenient button: you can now use this application.

## Functions

* You can open a specific link or open all at once.

* You can delete or add links.

## Contacts
